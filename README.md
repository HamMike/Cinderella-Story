# Cinderella-Story

Project #1:
CaddyShack Memory Game

Overview:
Cinderella-Story is a two person, CaddyShack themed, memory game. When the page is loaded, so does the game ready beginning. Players alternate taking turns clicking on golf icons trying to find matching images. When all "golf balls" have been turned over a winner is determined by finding the most pairs. A reset button starts the game over.


Technologies:
HTML5
CSS
jQuery
pixlr

Unsolved Problems:
The responsive design can still be tinkered with for better precision. Over-clicking icons can cause bugs in the game play.

Further Development:
Adding sounds and icon clearing animation when pairs are made.
